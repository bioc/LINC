Description: This package enables the annotation of ncRNAs based on
        expression datasets. The underlying principle is called 'guilty
        by association' meaning a non-coding RNA is assumed to the have
        the a similar biological function as the group of its
        associated (co-expressed) protein-coding genes. In the first
        step a correlation matrix is computed storing the correlation
        of coding and non-coding genes. Secondly, query genes and their
        associated genes with high correlations can be extracted. The
        third step calls a gene ontology to retrieve the biological
        function of associated genes.
