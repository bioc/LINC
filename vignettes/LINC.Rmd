## 0.0 Introduction

In the last years a class of ncRNAs were described named lincRNAs (large intergenic noncoding RNAs) as untranslated transcripts with a length of over 200 bp. [1, 2] A number of papers focused on their tissue-specific upregulation in cancer cells. [1, 3, 4] The annotation and functional classification of lincRNAs (and ncRNAs) remain challenging. Given a RNAseq or microarray experiment, one possible approach to identify candidate ncRNAs poses ``guilty by association'', a principle stating that coding and noncoding genes showing a comparable expression pattern are likely to share functionality. [5] This idea can now be easily applied on arbitrary expression matrices using this R package *LINC*.
The basic section will introduce the function *justlinc()* which will immediately give results. In the sections focusing on the advanced methods more complex functions are described providing control over most thresholds used in the computations. This package is intended to describe lincRNAs and their interaction to other lincRNAs plus protein-coding genes based on gene expression data.
 
## 1.0 Basic: Computation in one step!

The function *justlinc* is a wrapper. It requires a gene expression matrix with columns corresponding to samples and rows to genes. A preprocessing of the matrix is not mandatory. Gene ids need to be given preferably as Ensembl gene ids. **Importanly, this function uses predefined thresholds, so it will not give a result in every case! On the other hand it does not need additional information.**  
The following commands show how *justlinc* is called. (Please note, that the large gene expression matrix named *GTEX_LIVER_CRUDE* is not provided in this Version of the package.) 

```{r fig.width = 14, fig.height = 12, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(require(LINC)))
data(LIVER_EXPR)

# a gene expression matrix with > 50,000 genes
str(GTEX_LIVER_CRUDE)

# 'justlinc' will search for the 10 best candidates
justlinc(GTEX_LIVER_CRUDE)
```

The optional argument *targetGenes* can be either a gene *'biotype'* (the default value is *'lincRNA'*), a single candidate gene or a vector of genes.

```{r fig.width = 9.5, fig.height = 11.5, fig.keep='first', warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# 'justlinc' called with queries
my_lincRNAs <- c("ENSG00000224153", "ENSG00000197813",
                 "ENSG00000179136", "ENSG00000259439",
                 "ENSG00000267462")

res <- justlinc(GTEX_LIVER_CRUDE, targetGenes = my_lincRNAs)
```

For multiple candidate genes it is assumed that they have a connection, for instance comparable co-expression pattern. This relationship is represented by the dendrogram (marked in dark red). As distance between two lincRNAs the Czekanovski dice distance [6] is considered, a measure for the number of shared interaction partners. The pathways found for the co-expressed genes are shown below the dendrogram.   

## 2.0 Advanced 1: correlation matrix and statistics

The main function of this package termed *linc()* computes a correlation matrix and perfoms statistical correction. Spearman's rank correlations is the default method. It provides options for the removal of principle components and gene outliers. These methods can indicate whether correlation values are influenced by confounding factors. Negative correlation can be computed by providing a user-defined correlation function (example C). Protein-coding genes and queries (lincRNAs and other ncRNAs) are separated by the argument *codingGenes*, an assignment of protein-coding genes given as a *logical* vector or a vector of gene names. The output of this function is a *LINCmatrix* instance. These objects can be plotted applying the *plotlinc()* function. The resulting plot illustrates the statistics of the input matrix.
**It is useful to subset the input expression matrix such that only lincRNAs of interest as well as variance- and/or expression-selected protein-coding genes are considered!**

```{r fig.width = 17, fig.height = 10, warning = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(require(LINC)))
data(BRAIN_EXPR)

# (A) call 'linc' with no further arguments
crbl_matrix <- linc(cerebellum, codingGenes = pcgenes_crbl, verbose = FALSE)
# 'cerebellum' is a matrix of expression values; rows correspond to genes
# 'pcgenes_crbl' is a TRUE/FALSE vector; TRUE indicates a protein-coding gene 

# (B) remove first seven principle components
crbl_matrix_pc <- linc(cerebellum, codingGenes = pcgenes_crbl, rmPC = c(1:7), verbose = FALSE)

# (C) negative correlation by using 'userFun'
crbl_matrix_ncor <- linc(cerebellum, codingGenes = pcgenes_crbl,
                         userFun = function(x,y){ -cor(x,y) }, verbose = FALSE)

# (D) remove outliers using the ESD method
crbl_matrix_esd <- linc(cerebellum, codingGenes = pcgenes_crbl, outlier = "esd", verbose = FALSE)

# (E) plot this object
plotlinc(crbl_matrix_esd)
```

## 2.1 Advanced 2: cluster analysis or single query

Starting from the correlation matrix, the *LINCmatrix* object, there are two functions to compute either (I) a cluster with *clusterlinc()* or (II) an analysis for a single query with *singlelinc()*.
The *clusterlinc()* functions perfroms a correlation test (Spearman's rho by default) and clusters the candidate lincRNAs based on their interaction partners or their correlations.

```{r fig.width = 11.5, fig.height = 5, warning = FALSE, fig.keep='none', eval = TRUE}
# call 'clusterlinc' with no further arguments
crbl_cluster <- clusterlinc(crbl_matrix, verbose = FALSE)
# apply the distance method "correlation instead of "dicedist"
crbl_cluster_cor <- clusterlinc(crbl_matrix, distMethod = "correlation", verbose = FALSE)
# comparing two distance methods
plotlinc(crbl_cluster)
plotlinc(crbl_cluster_cor)
```

Another function *querycluster()* enables clustering not only across different lincRNAs in one data set, but also clustering of one lincRNA in multiple data sets. In order to distinguish between different expression matrices the function *feature* can be applied in order to add user-defined names (*customID*) and colors (*customCol*).

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5.5, warning = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# add custom names and colors
gbm_cluster <- gbm_cluster + feature(customID = "CANCER_GBM", customCol = "red")
ctx_cluster <- ctx_cluster + feature(customID = "HEALTHY_CTX", customCol = "blue")
hpc_cluster <- hpc_cluster + feature(customID = "HEALTHY_HPC", customCol = "blue")
crbl_cluster <- crbl_cluster + feature(customID = "HEALTHY_CRBL", customCol = "blue")

# plot the dendrogram
querycluster('647979', queryTitle = 'NORAD',
             gbm_cluster,  # Glioblastoma
             ctx_cluster,  # Cortex
             hpc_cluster,  # Hippocampus
             crbl_cluster) # Cerebellum
```

The enriched biological terms from gene annotation resources like *Reactome PA* and *Gene Ontology (GO)* for the cluster (multiple candidate lincRNA genes) can be identified applying *getbio()* which will call supported functions from the *clusterProfiler* package. [7 - 9] This analysis will reveal which functions, pathways or compartments are associated with the lincRNA-co-expressed genes.  

```{r, eval = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Function call for 'getbio()' and plotting:
crbl_cc <- getbio(crbl_cluster, translate = 'none', ont = "CC")
plotlinc(crbl_cc)
```

It can be interesting to compare two objects in terms of intersecting biological terms for shared queries. In the following example the terms for "cellular compartment" from *GO* are compared between two data sets, one representing the tissue Cortex and the other Cerebellum.

```{r fig.width = 9, fig.height = 7.5, fig.keep='first', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# compare two brain tissues using 'overlaylinc'
ctx_cc <- ctx_cc + feature(customID = "Cortex vs. Cerebellum")
overlaylinc(ctx_cc, crbl_cc)

# alternatively, compute the intersection of both objects
brain_cc <- ctx_cc + crbl_cc
plotlinc(brain_cc)
```

For a single query gene they function *singlelinc()* comes with many options in terms of co-expression selection. One can select for absolute values, negative correlations and a maximum for co-expressed genes. Here, the query is 'MEG3 - maternally expressed 3' (its Entrez gene id is '55384'). In contrast to *clusterlinc()*, *singlelinc()* will directly call a gene annotation resource for the co-expressed genes.

```{r fig.width = 21, fig.height = 10, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
meg3 <- singlelinc(crbl_matrix, query = "55384", threshold = 0.00005, ont = 'BP', verbose = FALSE)
plotlinc(meg3)
```

## 2.2 Advanced 3: Workflow and more about the *LINC* class

The figure below depicts the workflow for the adavanced mehods in the *LINC* package. For multiple queries the workflow as sequence of function calls would be *linc()* -> *clusterlinc()* -> *getbio()* -> *plotlinc()* ... and *linc()* -> *singlelinc()* -> *plotlinc()* for a single query. If there are more than > 100 queries (lincRNA genes) in the matrix it will be beneficial to subset the expression matrix.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3.5, eval = TRUE }
  overview_img <- readPNG(system.file("extdata", "overview_img.png",
                                     package ="LINC"))
    overview_plot <- rasterGrob(overview_img, interpolate = TRUE)
    grid.arrange(overview_plot)
```

As seen in the previous sections the function *linc()* produces a *LINCmatrix* instance, the function *clusterlinc()* a *LINCcluster* instance and so on. Two functions, termed *feature()* and *getlinc()*, provide quick access to the important data structures stored in these objects. Converting a *LINCcluster* into a *LINCmatrix* for instance could be useful in case one wants to plot the distribution of correlation values instead of the cluster applying *plotlinc()*. The function call *getlinc(..., subject = "queries")* will return the possible queries in the object. Calling *plotlinc(..., showCor =)* will output scatterplots of correlations between a query and up to five subjects. *getcoexpr()* returns a vector of co-expressed genes.

```{r fig.width = 11, fig.height = 7, warning = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data(BRAIN_EXPR)
class(crbl_matrix)

# feature() can be used to convert objects
crbl_matrix <- crbl_cluster + feature(setLevel = "LINCmatrix", showLevels = TRUE)

# getlinc() is used to accesss information
getlinc(crbl_cluster, subject = "geneSystem")
getlinc(crbl_cluster, subject = "queries")
# Get the co-expressed genes for the gene with the entrez id "441951" (ZFAS1)
zfas1 <- getcoexpr(crbl_cluster, query = "441951" ); str(zfas1)
str(crbl_matrix@assignment) # protein-coding genes are stored in the 'assignment' slot

plotlinc(crbl_cluster, showCor = c("647979", "6726", "3337", "3304" ,"3320"))
```

It is possible to write the ids of co-expressed genes of a *LINCcluster* object and the biological terms of a *LINCbio* object into a table. The size of the table is restricted to 500 observations for each query, respectively.

```{r eval = FALSE}
linctable(file_name = "crbl_co_expr", input = crbl_cluster)
```
